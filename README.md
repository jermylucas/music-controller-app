## Music Controller

This is a simple music controller app for learning Python / Django and doing some React. This will work with the Spotify API to pause and change music.

If installing on a new machine, make sure the following commands are complete:

- pip install django djangorestframework

It also may be worth installing the following extensions for developement. These are not necessary and some are just general code snippets:

- Python (Microsoft)
- Django (Baptiste Darthenay)
- ES7 React/Redux/... snippets (dsznajder)
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets (charalampos karypidis)
